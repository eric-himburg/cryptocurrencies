# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
An analysis of what cryptocurrencies are currently tradable on the market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for an investment was performed. A data set of known cryptocurrencies was processed and fit to machine learning models. Since there is no known output for how cryptocurrencies should be classified, an unsupervised learning model was employed. Details of the clustering algorithm and coding as well as the results are given below.

## Coding
There were four steps to the coding performed to classify the cryptocurrency data.  
* Preprocessing the Data for PCA -

* Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
